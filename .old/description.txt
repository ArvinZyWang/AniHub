Here is the very first version of the Repo,
which is also the first repo of the author,
after learning Python for about 5 months.

I hardly knew how to orgnize my codes,
how to setup my environment,
and how to orgnize data-structure,
(I used ONLY dictionaries to store data and pass arguments).
It was terribly written,
and impossible for further development.

But it was a great lesson,
that every beginner needs,
and a new beginning.
I just enjoy the feeling of creating something,
instead of having or claiming.

Thank you for reading. :)
